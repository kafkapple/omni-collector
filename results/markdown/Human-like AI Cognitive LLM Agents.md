Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (Paper Summary)Ege Atmaca4 min read·Jul 11, 2024--ListenShareCognitive Functions as Symbol TransformationsHistorical Background:Symbolic AI was one of the earlier research topics before data based machine learning approaches took over theresearchers interest with more promising results.The main idea was having a knowledge base of logical rules and reasoning based on these rules and symbols inputted.The main limitations was that the real world is:a. Complex → Too many rules to defineb. Stochastic → Rules can be fragileAll cognitive functions can be represented as symbol transformations based on input symbols and transformation rules.However, complexity and stochastic-dynamics of real life makes it unfeasible to predefine the rules required by an autonomous AI-agent.LLMs as Probabilistic Symbol TransformersWith the advancements of LLMs, we became able to:Learn complex & probabilistic transformations from data without explicit instructions.Use vast amount of unstructured text data both for learning implicit rules and also as a knowledge base.LLMs are actually high-level symbol transformers, which can learn and transform unstructured human-readable data.Architecture of a Human BrainFirst thing comes to our mind, when we think about how human brain / cognition works: Our brains process informationthrough many inter-connected neurons firing electrical signals, so we can think.Although that’s not wrong, evidence suggests, our brains contain specialized modules for different cognitive functions like perception, memory, and reasoning.On the other hand, these modules work inter-connected and they can even build higher-level cognitive functions like enabling decision-making through memory and reasoning.So, the state-of-the-art neurocognitive science suggests:Human brain has a modular architecture of function-specific neural networks, working collaboratively, and building higher-level cognitive functions layer by layer.Architecture of a Cognitive AgentDifferent Methods to Use LLMsA Pre-LLM Cognitive Architecture: SOARFrom LLMs to Language AgentsCognitive Architectures for Language Agents: CoALACognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA) aims to provide a framework for developing language agents. CoALA centers on LLMs as the core of a broader cognitive architecture.Decision-making procedure in CoALA is the entry point to run (or understand) the system. It involves cycles of planning and execution. During planning, actions are proposed, evaluated, and selected based on their value. Selected actions are executed, providing feedback for subsequent cycles.Memory modules include short-term working memory and long-term memories (episodic, semantic, procedural). Working memory holds active information for decision-making, while other memories store experiences, knowledge, and procedural instructions. Actions like reasoning and retrieval operate on this memory to support decision-making and learning.External actions encompass interactions with physical, human, and digital environments. Based on the external feedback, learning actions involve updating long-term memory, including episodic, semantic, and procedural knowledge.Overall, CoALA provides a structured framework for developing language agents, integrating memory, decision-making, action and learning processes.CoALA Action Categories:1.Internal Actions:Interacting with memory1.1.Planning:Proposal, evaluation, selection of action1.1.1.Retrieval:From procedural, semantic, episodic memory1.1.2.Reasoning:With LLMs or hard-coded instructions from procedural memory1.2Learning:Based on external feedback2.External Actions:Interacting with environment2.1.Grounding:Executing the planned actionActionable InsightsModular Agents:Structuring agents modularly enhances compatibility and ease of development. Standardized terms and open-source implementations would facilitate modular plug-and-play and re-use, similar to frameworks in robotics.Design Structure:CoALA suggests a structured approach to design agents, involving specifying internal memory, defining, internal action space, and decision-making procedures tailored to the application.LLMs vs. Code:Agents should balance the interpretability and extensibility of code with the flexibility of LLM parameters. Using code sparingly for generic algorithms can complement LLM limitations.Structured Reasoning with LLMs:Rather than relying solely on prompt engineering, a more structured reasoning procedure is proposed, utilizing prompting frameworks and output parsing solutions to update working memory variables efficiently.Long-term Memory:Memory-augmented language agents are proposed to autonomously generate and utilize selfgenerated content, enabling efficient lifelong learning through a combination of existing human knowledge and new experiences.Action Space:Defining a clear and task-suitable action space, encompassing both internal and external actions, is crucial for effective decision-making and systematizing agent design.Learning:Beyond in-context learning or fine-tuning, CoALA suggests meta-learning by modifying agent code and exploring new forms of learning and unlearning to enhance agent capabilities.Decision Making:Future directions include exploring decision-making procedures that go beyond single action generation, integrating language-based reasoning with code-based planning, extending deliberative reasoning to real-world settings, and improving efficiency through meta-reasoning and calibration.Resources:Sumers, T.
